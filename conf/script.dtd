 Please refer to [url] for full documentation

 STURCTURE 
 Define a single backup task between <task> tags. 
 
 Within the <task> tags add the following tags
   <source> - fully qualified path to the folder you wish to backup
   <destination> - fully qualified path to the folder where the backup files are copied to
   <rule> - a backup rule

 RULE   
 The "rule" can take one of the following values,
 
   all - all files will be copied from source to destination
   exists - only copy files that already exist destination
   changed - only copy source files whose timestamp is different from 
        destination OR if destination does not exist   
   exists changed - only copy source files whose timestamp is different from 
        destination AND file exists on destination
   new - only copy files that dont already exist on destination

 TASK TAG ATTRIBUTES      
 The <task> tag has attributes which take values "on" or "off", "true" or "false", "yes" or "no"
 
 recurse - if set to "on", will recurse subdirectories of the source folder. 
 mirror-delete - if set to "on", will delete files from destination that don't exist in source.
 active - whether this rule is active or not

  An example of a script XML document:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE backup-script SYSTEM "script.dtd">

    <backup-script>
      <log-level>0</log-level>
      <log-folder>1</log-folder>
      <task recurse="on" mirror-delete="on" active="on">
        <source>F:/source/</source>
        <destination>F:/destination</destination>
        <rule>all</rule>
      </task>
    </backup-script>
